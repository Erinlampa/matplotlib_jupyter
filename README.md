Pyber assignment

Takeaways from assignment:

There are fewer drivers in rural areas, but the fares are higher. 
This could potentially be due to the distance one must drive to get between locations in rural areas.

Urban fares are cheaper and there are more drivers. This most likely is due to the higher population within urban areas.
Distance traveled may also be lesser due to proximity within an urban environment.

Not surprisingly, suburban riding falls in the middle in terms of pricing. 
However, there are more drivers in the suburban areas than in rural areas. This may be due to commuters who use ride services to
commute in/out of an urban area.
